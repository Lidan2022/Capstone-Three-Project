# Alcohol Sale Forecasting
### Alcohol is a market with steady growth and profitability, but it is also a market with a few big names that try to take all the attention. So how do you set yourself apart from the competition? The goal of this project is to predict the Liquor company alcohol sales.The company can make their marketing plan according to the model outcoms.
## 1.Data Collecting
### Kaggle is the world's largest data science community with powerful tools and resources. From Kaggle, We collected this sufficient size of dataset to build a good predictor model. Here is the link of the data source: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgawlik/nyse](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bulentsiyah/for-simple-exercises-time-series-forecasting?select=Alcohol_Sales.csv)https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bulentsiyah/for-simple-exercises-time-series-forecasting?select=Alcohol_Sales.csv
## 2.Data Cleaning
### For data wrangling, we checked the basic information about the dataset. Checked the duplicated and missing values. Rename some column names to make them more readable. Use the to_datetime function in Pandas to change the index to datetime.

## 3.EDA And Preprocessing
### For Data exploratory analysis, We visualize and test the data stationary. Transformed the data set to be stationary. found the best parameter orders.

## 4.Modelling
### Now we started to build our Time series model. We used the best parameter order we chose to build a ARIMA model.[https://github.com/Lidan2022/Capstone-Two/blob/71b72a7f6616075b7b32cc758cb59a6cd6218c8e/Capstone%20Two%20New-Modeling.ipynb](https://github.com/Lidan2022/Capstone-Three-Project/blob/e6e858f946b619dd781c786fd4e55764f3f1a5e6/Complete%20Capstone%20Three_Time%20Series_Alcohol%20Sale%20Forecasting.ipynb)https://github.com/Lidan2022/Capstone-Three-Project/blob/e6e858f946b619dd781c786fd4e55764f3f1a5e6/Complete%20Capstone%20Three_Time%20Series_Alcohol%20Sale%20Forecasting.ipynb
## 5.Forecasting
### We splitted the data to training set and testting set. After fitted the data into trainning set. we used the model to forecasting the test set, visualize the trainning set and test set to compare. https://github.com/Lidan2022/Capstone-Three-Project/blob/e6e858f946b619dd781c786fd4e55764f3f1a5e6/Complete%20Capstone%20Three_Time%20Series_Alcohol%20Sale%20Forecasting.ipynb
